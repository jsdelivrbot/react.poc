##Criteria Met:

* Loading data by calling FruitasticApi.get().
* Creating a horizontal bar chart (no more than 400px wide) that shows how popular each fruit is compared to the others.
* This is based on the total number of favorites for each fruit.
* Each row has a label for the name of the fruit, plus its total count.
* There's no  axis with units on it.
* Underneath the bar chart, there is a list of all the items in the array you got from FruitasticApi.get().
* Each item displays the person's name and favorite fruit.
* ~~Each bar chart is click-able. when clicked,  row is highlighted~~
* Used console.log to output 'Fruit selected: {fruitname}, {fruitnameTotal}'
* No browser refresh, or navigate to another html page.


##Stretch goals met:

- When a bar chart row is clicked, the list is filtered to only display the people that chose that fruit as their favorite.
- ~~Create an animation where the bars grow to their correct width when the data is loaded.~~
- Stack each bar from top to bottom in order of most popular to least popular.
- Each bar is a different color.
